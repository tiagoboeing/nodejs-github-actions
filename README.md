**Complete CI/CD flow to work with GitHub Actions.**

_For now the workflows work only for repositories with the `master/main` branch. If you are working with `develop` and created something, please send a PR._

> This repository it's a template with the configurations for Release It package.

## Resources

- Auto generate releases on repository;
- Auto create tags on repository;
- Auto create changelog on repository;
- Auto commit and push changes on repository;
- Handle `version` property on `package.json` file;
- Build and push Docker image to Docker Hub (you can use Docker or not, remove theses steps on workflow files);
- Publish packages to NPM (disabled by default. You will ned to change some things.)

## Notes

This repository is template with all configurations for the package [`release-it`](https://github.com/release-it/release-it/). Bugs or questions about needs to be opened on the original repository.

## Starting

Simply use this template to create a new repository and start working on your project:

   1. Change other properties like `repository`, `author`, `license`, etc.
2. Change the Docker properties to your project name (or remove the files if you don't need Docker);
   1. Create two secrets on repository: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` ([how to create access token docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/));
3. Create a secret called `NPM_TOKEN` if you desire to publish your package to NPM;
4. Go to `.github/workflows/` folder and replace with your project settings;
